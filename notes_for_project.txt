if __name__ == "__main__": This line checks if the script is being run directly (i.e., from the command line) and not being imported as a module. If it is being run directly, the code within this block will execute.
inp = sys.argv[1] This line retrieves the second command line argument (the first argument, sys.argv[0], is always the script name itself). This is expected to be the path to an input file.
input_path = Path(inp) This line converts the input file path string into a Path object, which provides several methods and properties for manipulating and querying the file path.
input_file_name = input_path.stem This line retrieves the base name of the input file (i.e., the file name without the extension) using the stem property of the Path object.
output_file = Path(f'{input_file_name}.c') This line creates a Path object for the output file. The output file has the same base name as the input file but with a .c extension.
run_pipeline(input_path, output_file) Finally, this line calls the run_pipeline function (which is not defined in the provided code, but presumably exists elsewhere in the script or in an imported module). This function likely performs some sort of processing or transformation on the input file and writes the results to the output file.
